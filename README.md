**SAV-551+ LNA**

A 1-stage unconditionally stable 2.4GHz low noise amplifier with greater than 15db gain and a noise figure below 1.2db. The input/output of the amplifier is matched to 50 Ohms. 

Gerber Files of the LNA using the SAV-551+ ultra low noise transistor by MiniCircuits are provided. All components and voltage levels are noted in the pdf file.

**Important**: The design hasn't been tested yet. The measurments are from simulations in ADS by PathWave.
